# Music Releases

The aim of this project was to build a site to display the 50 most recent albums and singles on Spotify, using React and internally stored JSON.

## The problem

We built an Album component, which was exported and mounted in an App file, where all of the data was stored. We used StackOverflow and on-call support for help, and asked our team mates for help. We had difficulties mounting the Artists component into the Album, we solved this by coding directly into the ALbum component. IF we had more time, we would resolve this issue and from there display all artists.
